Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling Algorithm-
---------------------------------------------
This Algorithm is the preemptive version of SJF scheduling. In SRTF, the execution of the process can be stopped after certain amount of time.
At the arrival of every process, the short term scheduler schedules the process with the least remaining burst time among the list of available
processes and the running process.

Once all the processes are available in the ready queue, No preemption will be done and the algorithm will work as SJF scheduling.
The context of the process is saved in the Process Control Block when the process is removed from the execution and the next process is scheduled. 
This PCB is accessed on the next execution of this process.

Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm-
-------------------------------------------
Round Robin scheduling algorithm is one of the most popular scheduling algorithm which can actually be implemented in most of the operating systems. 
This is the preemptive version of first come first serve scheduling. The Algorithm focuses on Time Sharing.
In this algorithm, every process gets executed in a cyclic way. A certain time slice is defined in the system which is called time quantum.
Each process present in the ready queue is assigned the CPU for that time quantum, if the execution of the process is completed during that time then 
the process will terminate else the process will go back to the ready queue and waits for the next turn to complete the execution.


Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm-

Advantages
It can be actually implementable in the system because it is not depending on the burst time.
It doesn't suffer from the problem of starvation or convoy effect.
All the jobs get a fare allocation of CPU.

Disadvantages
The higher the time quantum, the higher the response time in the system.
The lower the time quantum, the higher the context switching overhead in the system.
Deciding a perfect time quantum is really a very difficult task in the system.
